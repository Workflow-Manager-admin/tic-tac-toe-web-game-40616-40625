# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## ðŸ§  AI Chatbot Feature

- A floating chat button appears on all screens. 
- Clicking it slides open a minimal chat panel for questions, tips, or fun with the Anthropic (Claude) AI.
- User queries are securely proxied via a minimal backend (`anthropic-proxy.js`) to protect API key privacy.
- Chat UI and components match the app style (Colors: #1976D2, #FBC02D, #E3F2FD).
- Securely add your Anthropic API Key as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment.

### To run the proxy server during development:
```bash
npm run chatbot-proxy-script
```

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Anthropic API Key

For the chatbot to work, set the API key in a `.env` file at the project root:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
CHATBOT_PROXY_PORT=3112
```

Start the proxy server with:

```
npm run chatbot-proxy-script
```

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
